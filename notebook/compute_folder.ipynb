    "\n",
    "In the DB, we have around 100 000 vectors of 1536 dimensions. Each vector represents the embeddings of a popular (> 100 votes) link on Hacker News. The vectors are computed using an OpenAI model.\n",

    "\n",
    "We use a clustering algorithm to group the vectors. Thanks to scikit-learn, we can use the [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) algorithm. We first divide the vectors into 8 clusters. Then, we divide each cluster into 8 clusters. We repeat this 6 times (because log8(100 000) ~= 5.5365).\n",

    "- id: the id of the post on Hacker News\n",
    "- embedding: the vector of 1536 dimensions\n",
    "- path: an array of integers representing the path (e.g [0, 5, 2] means the 0/5/2 path)\n"
